**Concepts of statistics used in Data Science**

1.Mean,median,mode


2.Weighted Mean

3.Quartiles

4.Interquartile range

5.Standard deviation

6.Probability

7.Conditional Probability

8.Normal Distribution

9.Central Limit Theorem

10.Binomial Distribution

11.Poisson Distribution

12.Geometric Distribution

13.Pearson Correlation coefficient

14.Spearman's Correlation coefficient

15.Least Error regression line (Linear regression)

*16.Multiple Linear regression (only this is solved by using numpy)

**These statistics problem are solved by using python programming languange without using sklearn,scipy,numpy, or any special library modules. These are solved manually using critical thinking.**
